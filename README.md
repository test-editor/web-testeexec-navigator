Test-Editor test execution navigator gui angular component

# TestexecNavigator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Setup development

Given a working installation of node, npm and yarn, run `yarn install`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` or `npm run test:once` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running the linter

Run `npm run lint` to execute the linter for the project.

## Packaging as library

Run `npm run packagr` to bundle the library into the dist folder via [ng-packagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr)

## Release process

In order to create a release, the version needs to be increased and tagged. This is done easily using `npm version`, for example:

```
npm version minor
```

After the commit and tag is pushed Travis will automatically deploy the tagged version.
